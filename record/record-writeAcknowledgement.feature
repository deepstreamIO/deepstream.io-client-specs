Feature: Record write acknowledgement
	Write acknowledgement when setting a record
	allows users to pass a callback to the set method
	of a record.

	It will be called with any errors while setting
	the record

Scenario: Record write acknowledgement

	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

	# The client creates a record and requires write acknowledgement
	Given the client creates a record named "happyRecord"
	And the client requires write acknowledgement on record "happyRecord"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|CR|happyRecord+
	Then the server sends the message R|A|S|happyRecord+

	# The client receives the initial record data
	When the server sends the message R|R|happyRecord|100|{"name":"John", "pets": [{"name":"Ruffles", "type":"dog","age":2}]}+
	Then the client record "happyRecord" data is {"name":"John", "pets": [{"name":"Ruffles", "type":"dog","age":2}]}

	# The client sends patch and gets acknowledgement
	When the client sets the record "happyRecord" "pets.0.name" to "Max"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|P|happyRecord|101|pets.0.name|SMax|{"writeSuccess":true}+

	Then the server sends the message R|WA|happyRecord|[101]|L+
	Then the client is notified that the record "happyRecord" was written without error
	
	# The client sends update and gets acknowledgement
	When the client sets the record "happyRecord" to {"newData":"someValue"}
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|U|happyRecord|102|{"newData":"someValue"}|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the server sends the message R|WA|happyRecord|[102]|L+
	Then the client is notified that the record "happyRecord" was written without error

	Then the client record "happyRecord" data is {"newData":"someValue"}

	# Sends update but gets an error
	When the client sets the record "happyRecord" to {"validData":"newErrorData"}
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|U|happyRecord|103|{"validData":"newErrorData"}|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the server sends the message R|WA|happyRecord|[103]|SError writing record to storage+
	Then the client is notified that the record "happyRecord" was written with error "Error writing record to storage"

	# Sends patch but gets an error
	When the client sets the record "happyRecord" "validData" to "differentData"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|P|happyRecord|104|validData|SdifferentData|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the server sends the message R|WA|happyRecord|[104]|SError writing record to cache+
	Then the client is notified that the record "happyRecord" was written with error "Error writing record to cache"

	# Gets version conflict but reconciles and receives write acknowledgement
	When the client sets the record "happyRecord" "validData" to "someData"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|P|happyRecord|105|validData|SsomeData|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the server sends the message R|E|VERSION_EXISTS|happyRecord|105|{"validData":"newErrorData"}|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|U|happyRecord|106|{"validData":"newErrorData"}|{"writeSuccess":true}+
	Then the server sends the message R|WA|happyRecord|[106]|L+
