Feature: Record Listen
	Listening to Record usage allows the client to reduce the amount 
	of records it needs to update. If a client requests a record that 
	matches your pattern or when all the clients discard it you'll be 
	told so you can only need to update records that you know are 
	being listened used.

	This helps reduce the amount of updates you have in the system at 
	any time. Please note,  when using records to update values within
	the deepstream database which is also queried you will need to 
	ensure those records are requested for the query to work with the 
	latest data, or avoid using listen for those records.

Scenario: The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

Scenario: The client listens to recordPrefix
	When the client listens to a record matching "recordPrefix/.*"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|L|recordPrefix/.*+

Scenario: The server responds with a listen ACK
	Given the server sends the message R|A|L|recordPrefix/.*+

Scenario: The client gets notified of new matching subscriptions
	Given the server sends the message R|SP|recordPrefix/.*|recordPrefix/foundAMatch+
	Then the client will be notified of new record match "recordPrefix/foundAMatch"

Scenario: The client gets notified for removed subscriptions
	Given the server sends the message R|SR|recordPrefix/.*|recordPrefix/foundAMatch+
	Then the client will be notified of record match removal "recordPrefix/foundAMatch"

Scenario: The client unlistens to recordPrefix
	When the client unlistens to a record matching "recordPrefix/.*"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|UL|recordPrefix/.*+

Scenario: The server responds with an unlisten ACK
	#TODO
	#Given the server sends the message R|A|UL|recordPrefix/.*+

Scenario: Following server updates will throw an error
	Given the server sends the message R|SP|recordPrefix/.*|recordPrefix/foundAMatch+
	#TODO: This error message isn't great
	And the client throws a "UNSOLICITED_MESSAGE" error with message "recordPrefix/.*"
