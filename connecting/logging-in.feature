Feature: Logging In
	As soon as the client is initialised, it creates a connection with
	the server. However the connection is initially in a quarantine
	state until it sends an authentication message. The auth message
	(A|REQ|<JSON authData>) must always be the first message send by
	the client.

Scenario: The client logs in with valid authentication credentials

	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
	When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
	Then the last message the server recieved is A|REQ|{"username":"XXX","password":"YYY"}+
		And the clients connection state is "AUTHENTICATING"

# The client receives a login confirmation
	When the server sends the message A|A+
	Then the clients connection state is "OPEN"
		And the last login was successful

Scenario: The client logs in with invalid credentials

	Given the client is initialised
	When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		But the server sends the message A|E|INVALID_AUTH_DATA|Sinvalid authentication data+
	Then the last login failed with error message "invalid authentication data"

# The client's authentication data is rejected
	When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "ZZZ"
		But the server sends the message A|E|INVALID_AUTH_DATA|Sinvalid authentication data+
	Then the last login failed with error message "invalid authentication data"

# The client has made too many unsuccessful authentication attempts
	When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "ZZZ"
		But the server sends the message A|E|TOO_MANY_AUTH_ATTEMPTS|Stoo many authentication attempts+
	Then the last login failed with error message "too many authentication attempts"

Scenario: The client tries to login when it is already authenticated

	Given the client is initialised
	  And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+
		And the last login was successful

	When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		But the server sends the message A|E|ALREADY_AUTHENTICATED+
	Then the client throws a "ALREADY_AUTHENTICATED" error with message "this client's connection is already authenticated"
