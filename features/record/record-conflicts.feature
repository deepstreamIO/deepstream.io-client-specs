Feature: Record Conflicts
	Record conflicts occur most often when the client disconnects, 
	does offline work and then reconnects resulting in a merge issue 
	with other potential edits, but can also occur in rare conditions 
	as part of a race condition. If a conflict does occur, the client 
	should recieve a VERSION_EXISTS error.

	Please note this will change as part of the MERGE epic planned, 
	and users will be notified instead that the write failed and be 
	allowed to effectively merge/rebase it as needed. When 
	implementing please let the core team know so we can collabarate.

Scenario: The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

Scenario: The server requests a record
	Given the client creates a record named "mergeRecord"

Scenario: The server responds with ack and read
	When the server sends the message R|A|S|mergeRecord+
	And the server sends the message R|R|mergeRecord|100|{"key":"value1"}+

 Scenario: The client recieves an out of sync update
 	When the server sends the message R|U|mergeRecord|102|{"key":"value3"}+
 	Then the client throws a "VERSION_EXISTS" error with message "mergeRecord"
 
 Scenario: The client sends an partial update
 	When the client sets the record "mergeRecord" "key" to "value4"
 
 Scenario: The client recieves an error saying version already exists
 	When the server sends the message R|E|VERSION_EXISTS|mergeRecord|102+
 	Then the client throws a "VERSION_EXISTS" error with message "mergeRecord"
