@rpc
Feature: Making RPCS
	Remote Procedure Calls are deepstream's concept of request-response communication. This requires
	a client that makes the RPC (requestor or receiver) and another client that answers it (provider)

Scenario: The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the client logs in with username XXX and password YYY
		And the server sends the message A|A+

# Success 

Scenario: The client makes an RPC
	When the client requests RPC toUppercase with data abc
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

Scenario: The client gets an ACK
	When the server sends the message P|A|REQ|<UID>+

Scenario: The client receives a succesful response
	When the server sends the message P|RES|toUppercase|<UID>|SABC+
	Then the client recieves a successful RPC callback for toUppercase with data ABC

# Error

Scenario: The client makes an RPC
	When the client requests RPC toUppercase with data abc
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

Scenario: The client gets an ACK
	When the server sends the message P|A|REQ|<UID>+

Scenario: The client receives an error response
	When the server sends the message P|E|RPC Error Message|toUppercase|<UID>+
	Then the client recieves an error RPC callback for toUppercase with the message "RPC Error Message"
