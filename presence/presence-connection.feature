Feature: Presence Connectivity
	Presence subscription must be sent to the server.
    after connection issues to guarantee
	it continues receiving them correctly.

Scenario: Client loses connection

	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

	Given the client subscribes to presence events
    Then the server received the message U|S|S+

    # The server sends an ACK message for subscription
    Given the server sends the message U|A|S|U+

	# The client loses its connection to the server
	When the connection to the server is lost
	Given two seconds later
	Then the client throws a "connectionError" error with message "Can't connect! Deepstream server unreachable on ws://localhost:7777/deepstream"
		And the clients connection state is "RECONNECTING"

	# The client tries to query for connected clients
	Given the client queries for connected clients
	Then the server did not receive any messages

	# The client reconnects to the server
	When the connection to the server is reestablished
	And the server sends the message C|A+
	Then the clients connection state is "AUTHENTICATING"

	# The client successfully reconnects
	Given the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+
	Then the clients connection state is "OPEN"

	# The client resends the presence subscription
	Then the server received the message U|S|S+

	# The client resends the query
	Then the server received the message U|Q|Q+
